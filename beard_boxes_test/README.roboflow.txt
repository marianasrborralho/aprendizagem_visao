The dataset includes 11327 images.
Face_Attribute are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 240x240 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 25 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -0째 to +0째 horizontally and -0째 to +0째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -19 and +19 degrees
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 3 percent of pixels
